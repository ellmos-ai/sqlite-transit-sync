# Security

## Supported use

Use the module only with local live databases and a transport whose participants are
trusted. Keep node state outside the shared transport. Restrict filesystem access to
database, state and transit paths.

### Transit path and manifest boundary

Readers accept only a direct regular manifest in the canonical transit
directory. The manifest may name exactly one relative snapshot filename;
absolute paths, traversal components, nested paths, symlinks and Windows
reparse points fail closed before hashing, SQLite `quick_check` or merge. A
successful SHA-256 check therefore means that the bytes match the manifest,
not that the sender or transport is authenticated. Add signatures or an
authenticated transport when the transit is not fully trusted.

## Required application review

Before deployment, define:

1. every table that must be excluded from merge;
2. every table whose rows must be removed from published snapshots;
3. timestamp and clock policy;
4. deletion/tombstone behavior;
5. transport authentication and retention;
6. database migrations and rollback.

Since 0.2.0 a second, independent guard runs before publication:
`scan_snapshot_for_secrets` (default **on**) inspects snapshot *content* and aborts the push
when a credential-shaped value is found, naming `table.column` but never the value. It exists
because the table rule below can only drop tables you already anticipated, while credentials
in practice end up pasted into free-text columns. It is a safety net, not a guarantee:
patterns are vendor-prefixed, so a bespoke or unprefixed secret still passes. Treat a clean
scan as "no known pattern matched", never as "this snapshot is free of secrets". Disable it
only with `scan_snapshot_for_secrets = false`, and prefer `secret_scan_skip_tables` when a
single table produces false positives.

The default `snapshot_exclude_tables = ["secrets"]` is only a safety baseline. It
cannot identify application-specific private or regulated data.

When a listed table exists, sqlite-transit-sync deletes its rows from the
snapshot and runs `VACUUM` before publishing. This reduces residual bytes in the
snapshot file, but it is not a substitute for a complete application-specific
redaction list.

## Reporting

Do not include live databases, snapshots, credentials or personal records in a bug
report. Provide a minimal synthetic database and redacted manifest instead.
