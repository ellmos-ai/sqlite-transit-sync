Local-first synchronization for independent SQLite databases through verified
snapshots and application-selectable merge policies. It is extracted from the
BACH ProSync architecture without BACH, OneDrive, host-name, or user-path
dependencies.

This is **not a distributed SQL server**. Every node owns and opens only its
local database. A shared folder, object-store mount, removable drive, or other
file transport carries closed snapshots plus manifests. Pulling verifies and
merges a snapshot into the local database inside one transaction.

Pairs well with [sync-master](https://github.com/dev-bricks/sync-master)
(same module family): a sync-master yard is a natural transit transport —
point `--transit` at a tool-owned `db-transit/<namespace>/` zone inside the
yard (its protocol rule R9). sync-master carries the documents, this module
owns database integrity and merging; both stay independent.

## Part of the ellmos stack family

`sqlite-transit-sync` is a companion to
[dev-bricks/sync-master](https://github.com/dev-bricks/sync-master) in the
same module family: sync-master owns file transport (`sync.files`), this
module owns database integrity and merging (`sync.database`). Both work
standalone or composed into stacks from the
[ellmos-ai](https://github.com/ellmos-ai) family — see the
[ellmos-ai/stacks](https://github.com/ellmos-ai/stacks) catalog. Its role in
that toolkit: no live SQLite over file-sync — only verified snapshots plus
application-selectable merge policies.

## What it provides

- consistent online snapshots through SQLite's backup API;
- atomic publication using a temporary file and `os.replace`;
- closed, rollback-journal snapshots with fail-closed cleanup of every temporary
  SQLite sidecar before publication;
- SHA-256 manifest and `PRAGMA quick_check` verification;
- per-node local pull state and idempotent replay;
- row-level last-write-wins per primary key for timestamped tables;
- shared-column merge for basic schema drift tolerance;
- configurable table exclusion and snapshot redaction with post-delete VACUUM;
- a content-level credential scan that aborts publication when a snapshot still
  contains credential-shaped values (on by default; reports `table.column`, never
  the value itself);
- custom `MergePolicy` support for domain rules, tombstones or CRDTs;
- verified snapshot cleanup with a dry-run default, local-node scope by default,
  and explicit opt-ins for deletion and foreign-node administration;
- selected pending pulls for thin application lifecycle adapters without duplicating merge or
  state-advancement logic;
- an optional [Republica showcase mode](#republica--the-showcase-method) that distributes a database
  one way as an encrypted payload and materialises it as a separate read-only showcase,
  instead of merging it;
- dependency-free Python API and JSON CLI (Republica mode adds `cryptography`).

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

## Quick start

Create a config on every node. Each node uses its own database and state file,
but the same transit directory and namespace.

```bash
sqlite-transit-sync init \
  --config node.json \
  --database ./app.db \
  --transit ./shared-transit \
  --node-id laptop \
  --namespace my-app

sqlite-transit-sync push --config node.json
sqlite-transit-sync pull --config node.json --dry-run
sqlite-transit-sync pull --config node.json
sqlite-transit-sync status --config node.json
sqlite-transit-sync verify --config node.json
sqlite-transit-sync cleanup --config node.json
# Review the JSON plan, then explicitly apply it:
sqlite-transit-sync cleanup --config node.json --apply
```

The application schema must already exist on each node. Automatic first-copy
is intentionally disabled because a generic module cannot decide which schema,
secrets, local tables or migrations belong to an application.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "database": "./app.db",
  "transit": "./shared-transit",
  "state": "./node-state.json",
  "node_id": "laptop",
  "namespace": "my-app",
  "timestamp_columns": ["updated_at", "modified_at", "created_at"],
  "exclude_tables": ["secrets", "sqlite_sequence"],
  "snapshot_exclude_tables": ["secrets"],
  "scan_snapshot_for_secrets": true,
  "secret_scan_skip_tables": [],
  "secret_scan_extra_patterns": [],
  "secret_patterns_file": null
}
```

Relative paths are resolved from the config file. The live database must never
be located inside the transit directory.

Applications that need an audit hash for exactly the parsed configuration can
read the bytes once and use the same source-relative parser without a second
file read:

```python
import hashlib
from pathlib import Path

from sqlite_transit_sync import SyncConfig

config_path = Path("node.json").resolve()
payload = config_path.read_bytes()
config = SyncConfig.from_bytes(payload, source_path=config_path)
config_sha256 = hashlib.sha256(payload).hexdigest()
```

### All keys and their defaults

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `database` | *(required)* | Live SQLite database owned by this node |
| `transit` | *(required)* | Shared directory carrying snapshots and manifests |
| `state` | `./.sync-state.json` | Per-node pull state; keep it out of the transit |
| `node_id` | machine hostname | Identifies the publishing node in snapshot names |
| `namespace` | `"default"` | Separates unrelated datasets in one transit |
| `timestamp_columns` | `["updated_at","modified_at","created_at"]` | Columns consulted for last-write-wins |
| `exclude_tables` | `["secrets","sqlite_sequence"]` | Tables never **merged** into the local database |
| `snapshot_exclude_tables` | `["secrets"]` | Tables whose rows are **deleted from the snapshot** before publication (then `VACUUM`) |
| `scan_snapshot_for_secrets` | `true` | Abort publication when snapshot content still looks like a credential |
| `secret_scan_skip_tables` | `[]` | Tables the scan ignores — use for a single noisy table instead of disabling the scan |
| `secret_scan_extra_patterns` | `[]` | Additional regexes, on top of the trigger file |
| `secret_patterns_file` | `null` (bundled file) | Path to your own trigger file; **replaces** the built-in patterns |
| `key_file` | `null`, else `$SQLITE_TRANSIT_SYNC_KEY_FILE` | Fernet key for Republica mode; must stay outside the transit |
| `republica_root` | `~/.republica` | Where imported showcases are written; must stay outside the transit |
| `allow_key_in_synced_folder` | `false` | Waives the check that refuses a key inside a cloud-sync folder |

The `state` default in this table applies when a JSON configuration is loaded
without that key. `sqlite-transit-sync init` instead writes
`.<config-stem>-state.json` when `--state` is omitted (for `node.json`:
`.node-state.json`).

### The credential scan, and how to turn it off

`snapshot_exclude_tables` can only drop a table you already anticipated. The scan
answers the question that rule cannot: *did a credential end up pasted into a
free-text column* — a note, a log line, a session summary? It runs on the snapshot
copy after redaction and before publication. On a match it raises `SyncError`
naming `table.column`; the matched value is never included, so the credential does
not travel into logs, tracebacks or CI output. The partial snapshot is discarded,
so nothing reaches the transit directory.

**Turning it off is a legitimate choice**, not a workaround. If your transit is a
storage location you control and trust — your own server, an EU-hosted volume under
your contract, an encrypted removable drive — and you *want* credentials to travel
with the data, then set:

```json
{ "scan_snapshot_for_secrets": false }
```

Prefer `secret_scan_skip_tables` when only one table produces false positives:
keeping the scan on everywhere else is worth more than silencing it globally.

### Tuning the triggers

Patterns live in data, not code — `sqlite_transit_sync/credential-triggers.json` —
so detection can be tightened over time without waiting for a release:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "patterns": [
    { "name": "github", "regex": "gh[pousr]_[A-Za-z0-9]{16,}", "prefilter": "gh" },
    { "name": "acme-internal", "regex": "ACME-[0-9]{4}", "prefilter": "ACME-" }
  ]
}
```

- `prefilter` is an optional literal used as a cheap SQL `LIKE` pre-filter so large
  snapshots stay fast. It **must** appear in every value the regex can match,
  otherwise findings are missed. Omit it when no such literal exists — the scanner
  then reads the column in full for correctness.
- Point `secret_patterns_file` at your own copy to replace the defaults entirely,
  or use `secret_scan_extra_patterns` to add to them.

Patterns are deliberately vendor-prefixed. A generic "long hexadecimal string" rule
would flag checksums, UUIDs and git SHAs, which are legitimate database content — and
a scanner with a high false-positive rate gets switched off, which protects nothing.
Treat a clean scan as "no known pattern matched", never as "this snapshot is free of
secrets".

## Republica — the showcase method

Each machine puts an **encrypted showcase** of its database into a shared file area. Every
other machine can look at it; none can change it. Hence the name — a re-publication of a
database, readable only by whoever holds the key.

Use it when `push`/`pull` does not fit: you want to *read* what another node knows without
merging it into your rows, or the only thing the machines share is a folder — no server, no
open ports, no trust setup — and that folder must not see your content in the clear.

### Two modes, deliberately redundant

Republica is **not a stopgap until a proper tunnel exists.** It is the second of two modes
meant to run side by side, so that a failure in one does not stop the other:

| Failure | Direct sync (`push`/`pull`) | Republica |
|---|---|---|
| A machine is asleep or offline | stalls (no peer) | keeps working — drop off now, pick up later |
| VPN/SSH down, network blocks the tunnel | stalls | keeps working over the file area |
| Key rotation or trust setup pending | stalls | keeps working with the shared key |
| Shared folder broken, full or desynced | keeps working | stalls |
| No merge policy agreed for a dataset | not applicable | keeps working — nothing is merged |

The whole value is that it works on the day the other path does not, so keep it configured
and exercised even while the direct path is healthy.

### Setup cost: one key transfer

The shared key must reach the other machines through **some channel that is not the
transport itself** — an existing encrypted tunnel, a password manager, a USB stick, reading
it out over the phone. Once. After that a plain shared folder is enough, forever, even one
you do not trust.

```text
republica_root/
  laptop/my-app.sqlite      <- read-only showcase of laptop's database
  workstation/my-app.sqlite <- read-only showcase of workstation's database
```

```bash
# Once per key, on local disk - never inside the transit, never in a synced folder.
# Then copy this file to the other machines out of band; do NOT run keygen there.
sqlite-transit-sync keygen --key-file ~/.keys/republica.key

sqlite-transit-sync init --config node.json \
  --database ./app.db --transit ./shared-transit \
  --node-id laptop --namespace my-app \
  --key-file ~/.keys/republica.key

sqlite-transit-sync republica-publish --config node.json   # encrypt and publish
sqlite-transit-sync republica-list    --config node.json   # what other nodes offer
sqlite-transit-sync republica-import  --config node.json   # materialise them locally
```

Requires the optional cipher: `pip install 'sqlite-transit-sync[crypto]'`.

**What travels** is not a database file but a curated SQL dump, gzip-compressed and
Fernet-encrypted. On a real 53.6 MB knowledge database that is 11.0 MB in transit, because
full-text index internals are rebuilt on arrival instead of shipped (35370 of 49636 dump
statements). The publication passes the same gate as a merge snapshot — redaction,
credential scan, `quick_check`, manifest.

**What it protects:** the transport sees ciphertext, and Fernet's HMAC detects deliberate
modification even when the manifest hash was recomputed to match.

**What it does not:** Fernet authenticates the *key*, not the *sender* — anyone holding it
can publish a valid snapshot. That is exactly why a replica is kept separate and never
merged. Keep the key out of the transport: a key inside the transit directory is refused,
and so is one in a folder that looks synchronised (override with
`allow_key_in_synced_folder`). The same rule applies to `republica_root` — a decrypted
replica inside the transit would be redistributed in the clear.

**Limit:** a full-text index without its own content (`content=''`) cannot be rebuilt,
because there is nothing to rebuild it from. Such tables are reported in the manifest as
`contentless_fts` instead of arriving silently empty.

### Sealed envelope: one file, same channel, never a database

The bootstrap problem: two machines share no secure channel *yet*, and that is exactly why a
credential has to cross. The same key and the same folder can carry a single encrypted file.

```bash
sqlite-transit-sync envelope-send    --config node.json --file ./api-token.txt --label api-token
sqlite-transit-sync envelope-receive --config node.json --into ~/credentials
```

The file arrives **as a file** (mode `0600`), named `<source-node>__<filename>`, and never
enters a database — a secret in a database gets copied onward by every backup, index and
sync that touches it. Notes should record where a secret lives, never the secret.

Two showcase rules are inverted on purpose: the **credential scan does not apply** (it would
block the very payload being moved), and the envelope is **removed from the transit** after
receipt, so a secret does not linger in a shared folder. Unsealing into the transit or into a
folder that looks cloud-synced is refused, and the filename is re-sanitised on arrival so a
crafted manifest cannot write outside the target directory.

This is a courier, not a password manager and not file sync — keep envelopes few and small.

## This is not a secrets manager

The scan **removes** credentials from the sync path. It does not **distribute** them.
If your actual problem is "my machines need the same passwords or API keys", this
module is the wrong tool — and so is any document-sync folder. Pick one of these
instead; all of them keep the plaintext away from a provider you do not control:

| Approach | Good for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Vaultwarden** (self-hosted Bitwarden) | humans + CLI on several machines | Runs on a small always-on box; reach it over a private network (WireGuard, Tailscale) instead of exposing it. Official Bitwarden clients, browser extensions and the `bw` CLI work against it, so scripts and agents can fetch secrets too. |
| **SOPS + age** | secrets that belong next to code | Encrypted files are safe to commit and safe to put in any sync folder, because only ciphertext travels. Per-recipient keys, works well with git review. |
| **`pass`** (GPG) + git | Unix-minded single users and small teams | One file per secret, ordinary git remote, no server at all. |
| **KeePassXC database over Syncthing** | no server, no cloud account | Peer-to-peer file sync; the vault itself stays a single encrypted file. |
| **Infisical / OpenBao (Vault fork)** | teams, machine identities, rotation | Real secret servers with audit logs and dynamic credentials — more moving parts than a household needs. |
| **Platform-native stores** | one machine, one app | macOS Keychain, Windows DPAPI/Credential Manager, `systemd-creds`, or your CI's secret store. No sync, but no exposure either. |

Whichever you choose, the split that matters is the same: **one channel for data,
another for credentials.** Then this module's job is simply to make sure the first
channel never quietly becomes the second — which is exactly what the scan enforces.

## Python API

```python
from sqlite_transit_sync import SyncConfig, TransitSync

sync = TransitSync(SyncConfig.from_file("node.json"))
snapshot = sync.push()
pending = sync.pending()
selected_reports = sync.pull_selected([pending[-1].path.name]) if pending else []
reports = sync.pull()
cleanup_plan = sync.cleanup()
print(
    snapshot.sha256,
    [report.as_dict() for report in reports],
    [report.as_dict() for report in selected_reports],
    cleanup_plan,
)
```

`pull_selected()` accepts only explicitly named snapshots that are currently pending and reuses
the same verification, merge and state gates as `pull()`. A thin lifecycle adapter can therefore
choose one eligible snapshot without copying the carrier's data mechanics.

Pass an object implementing `MergePolicy.merge(local, remote, snapshot)` to
`TransitSync` when timestamp LWW is not sufficient.

## Comparison with distributed SQL

| Aspect | `sqlite-transit-sync` | Distributed SQL, for example CockroachDB or YugabyteDB |
|---|---|---|
| Basic model | Every node owns an independent local SQLite database | All servers form one logical SQL database |
| Writes | Local first, synchronized later | Coordinated directly by the cluster |
| Synchronization | Asynchronous snapshot pull and row merge | Continuous replication between cluster nodes |
| Consistency | Eventual consistency after successful exchange | Usually strong or serializable consistency |
| Consensus and quorum | None required | Usually Raft-based majority consensus |
| Global transactions | No | Yes, including transactions spanning nodes or shards |
| Conflict handling | Application-specific `MergePolicy`; timestamp LWW is the default | Transactions, MVCC, locking and consensus |
| Offline operation | A node can continue reading and writing independently | Writes normally require a reachable quorum |
| Network outage | Local work continues; synchronization waits | Minority partitions may lose write availability |
| Failure handling | Local databases remain usable; transit and backups need separate protection | Replication and automatic failover while quorum remains available |
| Data visibility | Changes become shared after push and pull | Committed changes are immediately authoritative in the cluster |
| Schema changes | The application migrates every local database | Cluster-wide SQL migrations |
| Deletions | Require tombstones or a custom policy | Normal transactional SQL deletes |
| Infrastructure | Python, SQLite and a configurable file transport | Multiple permanent database servers, TLS, monitoring and backups |
| Minimum always-on servers | None; one node is sufficient | Commonly at least three for fault tolerance |
| Primary strength | Offline-first simplicity, low cost and domain-specific merge rules | Strong consistency, concurrent writers and high availability |
| Primary limitation | No global ACID transaction or immediate shared truth | Considerably higher operational complexity and resource use |

### Advantages, disadvantages and typical use cases

| System | Advantages | Disadvantages | Good use cases | Poor use cases |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sqlite-transit-sync` | Very small footprint; works offline; no central server; local privacy; transport-independent; merge rules can follow the application domain | Delayed visibility; application-owned conflict, deletion, clock and migration semantics; no global ACID; no quorum failover | Personal knowledge and task databases; local AI agents; laptop/workstation/server exchange; field and edge applications; desktop software with optional synchronization; research notes | Payments, scarce inventory, seat reservations, real-time collaboration on the same records, or many concurrent writers |
| Distributed SQL | Shared authoritative database; strong consistency; global transactions; coordinated concurrent writes; automatic replication and failover; horizontal scaling | Requires permanent servers, networking, certificates, monitoring and upgrades; quorum can reduce write availability during partitions; higher latency and cost | Financial and booking systems; SaaS platforms; e-commerce inventory; global accounts; multiplayer backends; high-availability enterprise services | Small personal tools, intermittently connected devices, single-user desktop applications, or workloads already handled reliably by local SQLite |

### Quick decision guide

| Requirement | Prefer |
|---|---|
| Nodes must keep working offline | `sqlite-transit-sync` |
| Updates may become visible after a synchronization step | `sqlite-transit-sync` |
| Data should remain local and conflicts are infrequent | `sqlite-transit-sync` |
| Many clients modify the same records concurrently | Distributed SQL |
| Every commit must be globally authoritative immediately | Distributed SQL |
| Global transactions or automatic cluster failover are mandatory | Distributed SQL |

For a small number of intermittently connected personal or edge devices,
`sqlite-transit-sync` is usually the simpler fit. A central PostgreSQL service
is often the next step when real concurrent writers appear. Distributed SQL
becomes compelling when strong consistency must also survive server failures
across several permanently operated nodes.

## Safety and limits

- Never open a live SQLite database from a network or cloud-sync folder.
- SHA-256 detects corruption but does not authenticate a hostile transport.
- Default LWW assumes comparable timestamps and does not infer deletions.
- Equal timestamps converge through a deterministic content tie-breaker; this is a
  technical fallback, not a substitute for domain conflict rules.
- Tables without a primary key or timestamp column are skipped.
- Snapshot redaction deletes listed tables and VACUUMs the snapshot, but it must
  still list every table containing credentials or private data; the generic
  module cannot discover domain secrets reliably.
- Application migrations, clock policy, retention parameters and conflict semantics stay
  with the integrating application. `cleanup` supplies only the mechanism: it verifies every
  pair, performs a dry-run by default, keeps the newest ten snapshots per node, and manages
  foreign nodes only when `--all-nodes` is explicit.
- Run only one sync process per node unless the host application adds a process lock.
